If my FreshBooks subdomain is https://ryan953.freshbooks.com and I usually make
API requests to https://ryan953.freshbooks.com/api/2.1/xml-in with the token 
<private_token> then from your local machine:
curl http://localhost:8888/invoice/list -u "ryan953:<private_token>" -d "{\"status\":\"paid\"}"

or 

curl http://localhost:8888/invoice/list?status=paid -u "ryan953:<private_token>"

will both return the same results. JSONreflect will translate both GET and POST 
requests into POST request for the FreshBooks API server to consume. The conversion 
makes no assumptions about the request contents and will only wrap the request
data with a <request method="XXX"> tag.

See http://developers.freshbooks.com/ for more API help.



To start the server install node.js and run:
node server.js


Using JSON instead of XML can reduce the response-size of a call by as much as 40%.
